When buying directly from the manufacturer the Collective buying participant saves up to 40% in construction and 70% in repairs.\r\nAn idea is that users join up into a group large enough to qualify for the wholesale price.\r\nThere is the Organizer - is the one who organizes the wholesale purchase from beginning to the end. He takes a certain percentage of the amount of all purchases, which establishes himself. But, as the organizer does not bear the costs of advertising, rental store, staff salaries, this is typically 2-15% and is negligible for the participants of buying.\r\n"], ["twitter_url", nil], ["updated_at", Mon, 13 Jan 2014 22:08:27 UTC +00:00]]

More often than not, the things that someone needs or wants are available in the local community and can be picked up that very day at a bargain. \n\nWe envision a world in which people are aware of everything that is available around them.

The focus, for now, is primarily on companies that employ semi-tractor trailer configurations.  Currently, it is very difficult to track the actual usage of tires ($/mile). Companies know they need tires, but cannot effectively quantify, thus reconcile, the usage of the tires. Companies do not have a very good handle of where any given tire is located, how many miles are on the tire, and how long a tire has been in service. By using patent pending technologies/methodologies, this system provides the ability to track the tire from its incorporation into a customer's facility to the tire's expiration. A company will be able to determine where any given tire is located, how long it has been in service, and what the tire usage is. Management will have the ability to predict tire purchases using trend analysis beyond. Additionally, this system can assist in the reduction of lost or stolen tires.

However, in the market there is no easy-to-use release management and deployment tool.\n\nThat led us to write our own software for release management. And that's how SyncRelease was born after we used and tested it in our real-world projects and making it better and better over the years from our own experiences.

Companies do not have a very good handle of where any given tire is located, how many miles are on the tire, and how long a tire has been in service. By using patent pending technologies/methodologies, this system provides the ability to track the tire from its incorporation into a customer's facility to the tire's expiration. A company will be able to determine where any given tire is located, how long it has been in service, and what the tire usage is. Management will have the ability to predict tire purchases using trend analysis beyond. Additionally, this system can assist in the reduction of lost or stolen tires.

The marketplace is intended for things that are for sale from the homes of people and fall under the categories of excess (second-hand) stuff, homemade items, and homegrown produce.\n\nValue and expediency are the drivers of e-commerce, and nothing is more wallet-friendly and convenient than buying from a neighbor. More often than not, the things that someone needs or wants are available in the local community and can be picked up that very day at a bargain. \n\nWe envision a world in which people are aware of everything that is available around them.

Companies know they need tires, but cannot effectively quantify, thus reconcile, the usage of the tires. Companies do not have a very good handle of where any given tire is located, how many miles are on the tire, and how long a tire has been in service. By using patent pending technologies/methodologies, this system provides the ability to track the tire from its incorporation into a customer's facility to the tire's expiration. A company will be able to determine where any given tire is located, how long it has been in service, and what the tire usage is. Management will have the ability to predict tire purchases using trend analysis beyond. Additionally, this system can assist in the reduction of lost or stolen tires.

The marketplace is intended for things that are for sale from the homes of people and fall under the categories of excess (second-hand) stuff, homemade items, and homegrown produce.\n\nValue and expediency are the drivers of e-commerce, and nothing is more wallet-friendly and convenient than buying from a neighbor. More often than not, the things that someone needs or wants are available in the local community and can be picked up that very day at a bargain. \n\nWe envision a world in which people are aware of everything that is available around them. Using Jumblets.com is a great way to reach out to potential customers in your community and to support local people and small businesses.\n\nPlease visit www.jumblets.com\n"], ["twitter_url", "http://www.twitter.com/Jumblets"], ["updated_at", Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:42:56 UTC +00:00]]

However, in the market there is no easy-to-use release management and deployment tool.\n\nThat led us to write our own software for release management. And that's how SyncRelease was born after we used and tested it in our real-world projects and making it better and better over the years from our own experiences.

Companies do not have a very good handle of where any given tire is located, how many miles are on the tire, and how long a tire has been in service. By using patent pending technologies/methodologies, this system provides the ability to track the tire from its incorporation into a customer's facility to the tire's expiration. A company will be able to determine where any given tire is located, how long it has been in service, and what the tire usage is. Management will have the ability to predict tire purchases using trend analysis beyond. Additionally, this system can assist in the reduction of lost or stolen tires.

Companies do not have a very good handle of where any given tire is located, how many miles are on the tire, and how long a tire has been in service. By using patent pending technologies/methodologies, this system provides the ability to track the tire from its incorporation into a customer's facility to the tire's expiration. A company will be able to determine where any given tire is located, how long it has been in service, and what the tire usage is. Management will have the ability to predict tire purchases using trend analysis beyond. Additionally, this system can assist in the reduction of lost or stolen tires.
